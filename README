# Big Brisket Barbecue - Project Website Plan

## 1. Project Summary

### Site to Redesign
- **Website**: [Big Brisket Barbecue](https://bigbrisketbarbecue.com/)

### Why the Client Needs a New Website
The current website lacks a modern design, responsiveness, and accessibility. Its slow loading speed and clunky navigation make it challenging for users to engage with the brand effectively. Improvements are required in content organization, visual appeal, and user-friendliness.

### Most Important Purpose
The primary purpose of the website is to attract barbecue enthusiasts and convert them into loyal customers by showcasing the quality of Big Brisket's food and catering services.

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: Local barbecue lovers seeking high-quality smoked meats and authentic barbecue experiences.
- **Secondary**: Event planners and businesses looking for catering services.

### Overall Message
Big Brisket Barbecue delivers premium, mouth-watering barbecue with exceptional service. The website should convey the brand’s authenticity, quality, and dedication to barbecue excellence.

### Desired Actions
1. Explore the menu and place an order.
2. Contact for catering services or event inquiries.
3. Visit the restaurant location.

### Issues with the Current Site
1. **Accessibility**: Lacks features like proper color contrast and keyboard navigation.
2. **Speed**: Pages load slowly, reducing user engagement.
3. **Design**: Outdated layout and visuals fail to reflect the brand's personality.
4. **Responsiveness**: Poorly optimized for mobile devices.
